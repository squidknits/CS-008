        <h1>Leave it better than when you found it</h1>

        <p>When camping or hiking, you can usually find a sign that tells you to "leave this place better than when you found it".  This means to clean up any garbage you create, keep on the trail/camp site and even pick up trash you might find, even if it's not yours.  This saying can be applied to our daily lives and how we treat this planet we call home.  And it's important now more than ever to be adopting this way of thinking.  This doesn't just mean picking up trash, although that is a vital part of it.  It also means moving away from the industrial activities that humans have grown to depend on for the last 150 years.  It's raised the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide from 280 parts per million to 400 parts per million in that time.  This is warming our planet and causing disastrous effects, like sea levels rising, stronger hurricanes, and more intense and frequent droughts and heat waves.  It's easy to see that something needs to be done to change the way human kind gets its energy- changing to renewable sources like solar, water and wind should be our first step in this journey.  But what is the average person's role in climate change, and how can they modify their daily lives to help slow its effects?  In a few easy ways; one being trimming down on waste and learning to compost and recycling regularly.  This lowers the amount of garbage buried in landfills that produce methane.  Another way to reduce your share of methane is to eat wisely- buy local and organic, grow some of your own food, and start moving away from meat, since 18% of greenhouse gas emissions come from meat and dairy production.  You can also start to take steps to being energy efficient. Turning off lights when you leave a room is good, but changing your lightbulbs to compact fluorescents or LEDs is even better.  Washing your clothes in cold or warm water instead of hot is a way you can help, and hang drying your clothes can help as well.  If it's an option, ask your utility to switch your account to clean renewable power.  Flying less is another way as well, choosing buses or trains, or even vacationing closer to home is a great way to lessen your carbon footprint.  Changing your transportation habits is a big one- transportation causes about 25% greenhouse gas emissions.  Start walking, cycling, or look into your local area's transit.  You'll save money on gas, and you might even get into better shape doing this.  Now, it may seem like all of these changes you can make in your own lifestyle, while good, don't make as much difference as you want.  That's when turning to your elected officials is the next step.  Tell them you want immediate action on climate change. Give them statistics and facts and remind them that reducing greenhouse gas emissions will build healthier communities, jumpstart economic innovation and growth and create new jobs.  Do your research next time you're at the polls, and vote for the politicians who support effective climate policies.  It may seem daunting, but it all really comes down to one simple thing- leaving this place, our place, better than when we found it. </p>
